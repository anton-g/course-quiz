# Course Quiz
Originally an assignment for multimedia course at Uppsala University but have now been expanded and includes support for different courses and other nifty features.

## Adding questions
- Fork and clone project
- Look at syntax in questions.xml
- Add new questions following the syntax
- Commit and create pull request

## ToDo
+ Test with other browsers than Safari.
+ Add settings for shuffling questions etc
+ Add a question submitter
+ Fix inline code support
+ Fix statistics
+ ~~Host on GH Pages~~
  + There seems to be an issue with GitHub Pages and JQuerys `$.get()`. Could possible be fixed by switching to `$.getJSON()` instead but that would require quite some rewrite.
